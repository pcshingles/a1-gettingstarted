Technical aspects:
    Used Vue.js to design MVC front-end. Creates dynamic webpage with tabs
    that re-rerender most of the page with different contents. Iframed
    my resume from linkedin, got a couple photos from my gphotos, and tried
    github but the api wasn't being helpful today. Heck, I even through in a
    LinkedIn API.

Design aspects:
    Used bootstrap css library for ease-of-viewing. Has navbar, colored container,
    for ease of access to different locations.
